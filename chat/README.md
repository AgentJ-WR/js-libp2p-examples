# Chat Example

This example will guide you through creating a basic Chat application with libp2p. The example provides you the opportunity to work through [Node.js][nodejs] or [Browser][browser] code.

Both examples will benefit from you using the provided [Bootstrap][bootstrap] node. You can view the README there

## Setup
**Important**: If you are running through this example by yourself you will need to run the Bootstrap node. If you are doing this with others on a local network, only 1 person should run the bootstrap server.

1. Run the bootstrap node
  1. From [./nodejs][nodejs], run `npm ci` to install the node modules.
  1. From [./nodejs/bootstrap][bootstrap], run `node index.js` to run the Bootstrap server. **Note**: You can also chat from the Bootstrap node terminal, once you have reached that point in the Example.
1. If you are doing the Browser example, do the setup instructions in that [README](./browser/README.md)

[nodejs]: ./nodejs
[browser]: ./nodejs
[bootstrap]: ./nodejs/bootstrap
