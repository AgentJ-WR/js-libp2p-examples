Example notes
====

## Peer Discovery
* Connect to Bootstrap nodes
* Discover locally with MDNS
* DHT randomWalk

* Adding a chat protocol and sending individual messages to peers sucks
  * It requires a connection to each peer you want to send to.
* Leveraging pubsub, we only need to connect to a single common node
